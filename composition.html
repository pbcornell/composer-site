`O little town of Bethlehem,
    How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
    The silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
    The everlasting Light:
The hopes and fears of all the years
    Are met in thee tonight.

O morning stars, together
    Proclaim the holy Birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
    And peace to men on earth;
Where Charity stands watching
    And Faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
    And Christmas comes once more.

How silently, how silently
    The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
    The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
    But, in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
    The dear Christ enters in.`,

This unwelcome caress does nothing for stress;

Used to walk for hours by the sanctuary;
    We were free and life was limitless.
This expanse between us holds nothing but dust;
    We were wrong, those days are gone.
Too long ago, so far away, missing you.

    Some stories end in a dismal place,
    Have to rewrite time and space.

Ever at peace, your soul is exemplary;
    It's your heart that guides every move.
I know you're dancing tonight, but I can't hold you tight;
    Missing you, always do...
Too long ago, so far away, missing you.`,

Strangers on a barren shore,

We would enter by the door,

So, when day grows dark and cold,

Lead Thy lambkins to the fold,

    "description": "During a day trip around the Olympic Peninsula with a dear friend, shortly after sunset we found a view overlooking the Pacific Ocean&mdash;waves rolled in, the moon shone, and stars began to appear.  In that setting and moment, it was so very easy for all the noise of daily life to fade to absolute nothing.  So serene, so beautiful!  I wanted to hold on to that moment, capture it, and find a way to share it with others.  This composition is my attempt to do just that.<p/>Archibald Lampman's poem &quot;Evening&quot; naturally resonated with this idea.  The poem guides the reader through the enchanting transition from dusk into evening, including moon-tipped dandelions, cool night winds, shining stars, and even chanting frogs.  This composition begins with a sequence of sustained notes that represent a unifying &quot;nature theme,&quot; which recurs in gloomy form as the piece progresses, and again on handchimes as &quot;One by one / Shine out the stars, and the great night comes on.&quot;  The music gradually fades, inviting the listener to delight in a resplendent evening as some of the earlier themes and creatures return, commingle, and gradually fade.",
    "lyrics":
`From upland slopes I see the cows file by,
Lowing, great-chested, down the homeward trail,
By dusking fields and meadows shining pale
With moon-tipped dandelions.    Flickering high,
A peevish night-hawk in the western sky
Beats up into the lucent solitudes,
Or drops with griding wing.    The stilly woods
Grow dark and deep and gloom mysteriously.
Cool night winds creep, and whisper in mine ear.
The homely cricket gossips at my feet.
From far-off pools and wastes of reeds I hear,
Clear and soft-piped, the chanting frogs break sweet
In full Pandean chorus.    One by one
Shine out the stars, and the great night comes on.`,

    "description": "Archibald Lampman’s sonnet &quot;Gentleness&quot; draws a sharp contrast between the pain and cruelty of humankind’s baser instincts (pride, self-will, greed, malice, ...) and the finer quality of gentleness, which the poet aligns with the beauty of nature (&quot;Like April sunshine, or the summer rain, Swells everywhere the buds of generous thought&quot;). More than simply contrasting the two, Lampman implores the reader to learn from nature and to strive toward gentleness: &quot;Can ye not learn it? will ye not be taught?&quot; This composition invites the listener to do the same.",

`Blind multitudes that jar confusèdly
   At strife, earth’s children, will ye never rest

With ravelling self-engendered misery?
And will ye never know, till sleep shall see
   Your graves, how dreadful and how dark indeed
   Are pride, self-will, and blind-voiced anger, greed,
And malice with its subtle cruelty?
How beautiful is gentleness, whose face
      Like April sunshine, or the summer rain,
   Swells everywhere the buds of generous thought;
So easy, and so sweet it is;  its grace
      Smoothes out so soon the tangled knots of pain.
   Can ye not learn it? will ye not be taught?`,

The music progresses at a thoughtful pace and leverages rich chords, as well as silence, to elevate the text by Canadian poet Archibald Lampman (1861-1899).  Instead of &quot;rhetoric, nor the stale Worn truths, that are but maddening mockeries To him whose grief outmasters all replies,&quot; Lampman offers the wisdom of tenderness, and the comfort that comes by simply being present with another in silence:",
    "lyrics":
`Comfort the sorrowful with watchful eyes
    In silence, for the tongue cannot avail.
    Vex not his wounds with rhetoric, nor the stale
Worn truths, that are but maddening mockeries
To him whose grief outmasters all replies.
    Only watch near him gently; do but bring
    The piteous help of silent ministering,
Watchful and tender.    This alone is wise.
So shall thy presence and thine every motion,
The grateful knowledge of thy sad devotion,
    Melt out the passionate hardness of his grief,
And break the flood-gates of the pent-up soul.
He shall bow down beneath thy mute control,
    And take thine hands, and weep, and find relief.`,

    "description": `This composition explores the experience of Cio-Cio-San, the lead character of Puccini's opera <i>Madama Butterfly</i>.  Puccini's delicate &quot;Coro a bocca chiusa&quot; (commonly known as the &quot;Humming Chorus&quot;) serves as the theme and represents the essence of Cio-Cio-San’s character&mdash;hope and faithfulness in the face of uncertainty.  Each subsequent variation represents a different aspect of her experience, following the opera’s order of events.
<p/>
It is important to clarify the intent of the final variation, &quot;Honor.&quot;  The opera presents Cio-Cio-San as an individual shamed by society due solely to the actions of others; shame that leads her to suicide.  The final variation of this composition ammends the story by affirming Cio-Cio-San’s honor as fully intact and not in need of restoration.  Her character&mdash;her faithfulness and hopefulness despite the admonitions of those around her&mdash;is to be revered in spite of the wrongs done to her by others.
<p/>
Puccini's theme is presented first, followed by six variations.
<blockquote>
1. Theme<br/>
2. Wedding<br/>
3. Waiting<br/>
4. Child<br/>
5. Loss<br/>
6. Death<br/>
7. Honor<br/>
